# BlendCascade

This is a simple yet effective pure JavaScript library to obtain a cascading effect.


## Tips and caveats

* Use of transparent (WEBP or PNG) images is strongly recommended, so any collision will look good.
* We only support exactly square images (correctly) for now. Support for rectangular images is planned.
