# BlendCascade

(c) 2024 Michele Beltrame - https://www.cattlegrid.info/ - mb@blendgroup.it

This is a simple yet effective pure JavaScript library to obtain a cascading effect.

<div style="width:100%;text-align:center;">
    <video width="80%" controls="" autoplay="" loop="">
        <source src="demo/demovideo.webm" />
    </video>
</div>

## Tips and caveats

* Use of transparent (WEBP or PNG) images is strongly recommended, so any collision will look good.
* We only support exactly square images (correctly) for now. Support for rectangular images is planned.
